Bringing together a growing a set of common re-usable components aimed at standardising our front end approach and speed
up development time.

## Installation - Site Template

Requires at least version 6 of Node. We reccomend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage
your Node versions.

This runs the development task, which starts compiling, watching, and live updating all our files as we change them.
Browsersync will start a server on port 3000, or do whatever you've configured it to do. You'll be able to see live
changes in all connected browsers.
